# text-merge
 
Text Merger is a web-based application that allows users to merge multiple texts into a single document. The application has been developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, and uses a NoSQL database to store user data.

*Features*
Allows users to enter multiple texts
Merges the texts while preserving their relative order
Saves the merged text as a JSON document
Records the processing time for the merge operation
Algorithm
The algorithm used for merging the texts is based on the user's selection of a specific character or string to use as a delimiter between the texts. The algorithm then concatenates the texts while preserving their relative order and the specified delimiter.

*Usage*
To use Text Merger, simply open the web application in a browser and enter the desired texts in the input fields. Click the "Merge" button to merge the texts, and then click the "Save" button to save the merged text as a JSON document. The processing time for the merge operation will also be displayed.

*Requirements*
Text Merger requires a web server with PHP support and a NoSQL database (MongoDB or similar) for storing user data.

*Installation*
To install Text Merger, simply download the source code and upload it to your web server. Update the database credentials in the "config.php" file to match your database settings.
